============

This is a pseudo-javascript code where I show the algorithm I follow when somebody wants to hire me. So I called it... (drumroll)... (more drumroll)... *hire-me algorithm*. Yeah.

I published this code as an internal *joke* on [my website](http://danibishop.com) and it became quite popular, so I decided to push it to Github, sit and watch how you, geeks, *fork the repo and write your own versions of it*.

Have fun (if you can!) and fork, fork, fork...

If you want to hate me, face by face, you can follow me on Twitter: [@danibluebishop](http://twitter.com/danibluebishop).

##Use##
You can't use this right now. C'mon, its just an HTML mock around a fake Javascript. The purpose is to read the JS file (*hire-me.js*) as a human and then laugh because it **is funny to explain things to people using code**. You know it.
